<h2 id="course-components">Course Components</h2>

<h3 id="lectures">Lectures</h3>
<p>The class meets twice a week for lectures and joint class activities. The class activities are designed to help you master the relevant materials, to work on your homework in groups, and to get you started on your project. The weekly schedule of lectures is posted on the course web site.</p>

<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>Labs are an important aspect of the course, as they are meant to give you the technical skills to successfully complete the homework assignments and projects, complementing the theoretical knowledge taught in lectures. Sections will typically consist of a short presentation and live coding, followed by time to complete some exercises with the help of the instructors. Lab topics and times are announced in the schedule. <strong>You are expected to bring your own computer with the neccesary software installed to all labs.</strong> Labs can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/datascience-course/2016-datascience-labs">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h3>
<p>The course schedule includes required weekly readings – you are free to study ahead, but the schedule ensures that you are prepared for the activities in class and the homework. The goal of the reading assignments is to familiarize yourself with new terminology and definitions, to learn new design and programming skills, and to determine which part of the subject needs more attention. The homework assignments will contain questions about the mandatory readings. When answering these, please be brief and to the point!</p>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Neither mathematics or computer science are spectator sports; mastery of either subject requires a significant amount of practice! Homework assignments provide an opportunity to practice your programming skills, think about analytical concepts in a new way, and to test your understanding of the material. The homework assignments are also designed to prepare you for your course project. You should view the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. The homework will be graded holistically to reflect this objective. Homework will be submitted through Canvas.</p>

<h3 id="course-project">Course Project</h3>
<p>At the core of this course is a course project. The goal of the project is to analyze a topic of your choosing and document your findings. You will acquire and clean the data, use tools from the class to explore, describe, and analyze the data, and evaluate the results to make a predictions. The path to a good project will involve mistakes and wrong turns. It is therefore important to recognize that mistakes are valuable in finding the path to a solution, but will require a significant amount of time. <strong>It is therefore imperative that you begin your project early!</strong> The project has an intermediate milestone that will allow you to get feedback and to iterate.<br />
In your project you will work closely with classmates in 2-3 person project teams.  You can find more information on the <a href="/2016/project/">project page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<h3 id="digital-etiquette">Digital Etiquette</h3>

<p>During lectures <strong>no internet-enabled devices (notebooks, smartphones, tablets, etc.) are permitted</strong>, unless they are necessary for class activity. While this may sound strict and weird for a CS class, there are good reasons for banning devices in the classroom: messengers and notifications are designed to grab your attention and are de-facto irresistible. Also, note-taking by hand versus on your computer was <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/21/0956797614524581">shown to be more efficient for learning</a> (<a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5776804/note-taking-by-hand-versus-laptop">news story</a>).</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368">more on the issue by Clay Shirky</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky">Prof. and writer on social and economic effects of Internet technologies</a>) and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-case-for-banning-laptops-in-the-classroom">Dan Rockmore</a> (<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rockmore/">Prof. of Computer Science at Dartmouth</a>).</p>

<h3 id="assessment-procedure">Assessment Procedure</h3>
<p>Your final grade will be determined by the number of points you collect. You can collect various amounts of points for the different parts of the class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homework: 60%, assessed on your individual submission.  The homework assignments are weighted based on difficulty and length (A two week homework counts more than a one week homework).</li>
  <li>Project: 40%, assessed on meeting the project criteria and your peer assessment. The 40% is split between the two milestones and the proposal. 5% are assigned to the proposal, 10% are assigned to your first milestone, 25% to your final submission.</li>
  <li>We will evaluate your work holistically beyond mechanical correctness and focus on the overall quality of the work using the following scale:</li>
</ul>

<p>100 = Excellent / no mistakes (or really minor)  <br />
90  <br />
80  = Good / some mistakes  <br />
70   <br />
60  <br />
50 = Fair / some major conceptual errors  <br />
40  <br />
30  <br />
20 = Poor / did not finish  <br />
10   <br />
0 = Did not participate / did not hand in</p>

<p>A weighted overall average of 10 constitutes a perfect grade and is equivalent to an A. Here are tentative grade ranges for you reference. Note that these might be adjusted.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>&gt; 95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A-</td>
      <td>&gt; 90 - ≤ 95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B+</td>
      <td>&gt; 85 - ≤ 90</td>

<p>In addition, the staff will select the top projects through a review and voting process. These projects will be presented during our last lecture, featured on the website, and get up to 12 points for their exceptional work. A small number of projects will win the coveted Best Project prize including Swiss chocolate.</p>

<h3 id="project-group-peer-assessment">Project Group Peer Assessment</h3>
<p>In the professional world, three important features affect your productivity and success: your own effort, the effort of people you depend on, and the way you work together. For this reason we have chosen a team-based approach that values all three of those features. After each team-based project you will provide an assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. Your scores on the projects are adjusted up or down depending on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your teammates’ view of your contributions to the team</li>
  <li>The accuracy of your own assessment of your contributions</li>
  <li>The accuracy of your assessment of each of your teammates’ contributions</li>
</ul>

<p>Your teammates’ assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall course evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>You are welcome (and encouraged!) to discuss the course’s ideas, material, and homework with others in order to better understand it, but <strong>the work you turn in must be your own</strong> (or for the project, yours and your teammate’s). For example, you must write your own code, and critically evaluate the results in your own words. You may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make available solutions to homeworks to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.</p>

<h3 id="quoting-sources">Quoting Sources</h3>
<p>You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header) and include a link to the source. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!</p>

<p>You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using  proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. You may not use existing complex combinations or large examples.</p>

<h3 id="missed-activities-and-assignment-deadlines">Missed Activities and Assignment Deadlines</h3>
<p>Projects and homework must be turned in on time, with the exception of late days for homework as stated below. Because of the emphasis on teamwork, it is important that everybody attends and proactively participates in class. Due to the collaborative nature of the activities, it is not possible to make up any missed team activities, such as project work. We understand, however, that certain factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to participate or to hand in work on time. If that factor is an extenuating circumstance, we will ask you to provide documentation directly issued by the University, and we will try to work out an agreeable solution with you (and your team).</p>

<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>
<p>You can turn in your assignment up to two days late, however, for each day that an assignment is turned in late we will deduct 10% from the total possible points. That is, one-day late is 10% off and two-days is 20% off. So if your assignment is two day late, the max number of points (out of 10) that you can receive is 8. By permission of the instructor in extenuating circumstances, you may use more that two late days, however, the 10% rule per day will still apply. If you have a verifiable medical condition or other special circumstances that interfere with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="regrading-policy">Regrading Policy</h3>
<p>It is very important to us that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please submit an explanation via email to us (the staff mailing list) <strong>within 7 days</strong> of receiving the grade. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment.</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>If you have a documented disability (physical or cognitive) that may impair your ability to complete assignments or otherwise participate in the course and satisfy course criteria, please meet with us at your earliest convenience to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations.</p>

<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>

<p>This class occasionally uses material developed for Harvard’s <a href="http://cs109.github.io">CS 109</a>, taught by Hanspeter Pfister, Joe Blitzstein, Rhaul Dave, and Verena Kayning. We have  drawn on materials and examples found online and tried our best to give credit by linking to the original source. You can find these credits mainly by direct links to the sources from the slides (e.g., hyperlinked from images). Please contact us if you find materials where the credit is missing or that you would rather have removed.</p>
