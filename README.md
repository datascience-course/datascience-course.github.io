### Datascience Course

This repository holds all versions of the Datascience Course website as shown on the main domain.

The index.html file automatically redirects to the latest year.

The 2016 subfolder of this repository is automatically created based on the [2016-datasciencecourse-website](https://github.com/datasciencecourse/2016-datasciencecourse-website) repository containing jekyll code. **Do not edit this page directly!**

All other years (after 2016) are stored in separate repositories, named after the year.
